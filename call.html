                        <p>DMR 2024 invites the submissions of long and short papers about original works on meaning 
                            representations. As the special theme of DMR 2024, we also invite the submissions of original 
                            research that have in any way leveraged, expanded, or been inspired by the <strong class="text-secondary">“Marthaverse of 
                            Meaning”</strong>— the 50 years of gold-standard contributions to the field of NLP by 2023 ACL lifetime 
                            Achievement Award recipient, Dr. Martha Palmer.

                        </div>

                        <p>DMR intends to bring together researchers who are producers and consumers of meaning 
                            representations and, through their interaction, gain a deeper understanding of the key elements 
                            of meaning representations that are the most valuable to the NLP community. The workshop will 
                            provide an opportunity for meaning representation researchers to present new frameworks and 
                            to critically examine existing frameworks with the goal of using their findings to inform the design 
                            of next-generation meaning representations. One particular goal is to explore opportunities and 
                            identify challenges in the design and use of meaning representations in multilingual settings. 
                            Another is to understand the relationship between distributed meaning representations trained 
                            on large data sets using network models and the symbolic meaning representations that are 
                            carefully designed and annotated by NLP researchers, with an aim of gaining a deeper 
                            understanding of areas where each type of meaning representation is the most effective.
                        </p>

                        </div>

                        <p>In her 2023 ACL Lifetime Achievement Award acceptance speech, Dr. Martha Palmer 
                            (University of Colorado, Boulder) sums up her 50 years of research in AI and NLP in six words: 
                            “Finding meaning, quite literally, in words.” This year's workshop honors Dr. Palmer's 
                            contributions with a special theme on resources, approaches, and applications that draw upon 
                            her manifold contributions to the field. These resources include Treebanks (Chinese and Arabic 
                            TreeBanks, Hindi and Urdu Treebanks), PropBanks (English, Chinese and Arabic), VerbNet, 
                            OntoNotes, Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), and Uniform Meaning Representation (UMR). 
                            These resources share attention to semantic detail combined with scalability and, 
                            therefore, an ability to generalize to and support a variety of different NLP applications and 
                            tasks. Indeed, the applicability of her research extends beyond the textual to the multimodal, 
                            where she has broadly contributed to the cross-modal event understanding.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>DMR 2024 seeks to highlight the depth and the breadth of Dr. Palmer's contributions and their 
                            influence over the field of natural language processing by inviting the submission of original 
                            works that have in any way leveraged, expanded, or been inspired by the ``Marthaverse of 
                            Meaning.'' We also seek to recognize Dr. Palmer's long tenure of dedication to outstanding 
                            mentorship that has been so powerful for the many students who have gone on to shape the 
                            NLP research community and the field at large.

                            rather than intended work and should clearly indicate the state of completion of the reported 
                            results. A paper accepted for presentation at the workshop must not be or have been presented 
                            at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings.

                            When submitting a paper from the START page, authors will be asked to provide essential 
                            information about resources (in a broad sense, i.e. also technologies, standards, evaluation kits, 
                            etc.) that have been used for the work described in the paper or are a new result of your 
                            research. Moreover, ELRA encourages all LREC-COLING authors to share the described LRs 
                            (data, tools, services, etc.) to enable their reuse and replicability of experiments (including

			  We also accept commitments from the ACL Rolling Review (ARR). All ARR commitments to DMR must have received all reviews and meta-reviews by March 25, 2024.

                            Reviewing of papers will be double-blind. Therefore, the paper must not 
                            include the authors’ names and affiliations or self-references that reveal any author’s 
                            identity–e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” should be replaced with citations such 
                            as “Smith (1991) previously showed …”. The submissions should also avoid links to 
                            non-anonymized repositories: the code should be either submitted as supplementary material in 
                            the final version of the paper, or as a link to an anonymized repository (e.g., Anonymous GitHub 
                            or Anonym Share). Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without 
                            review.
                        </p>
                        <p>If the paper is available as a preprint, this must be indicated on the 
                            submission form but not in the paper itself. In addition, DMR 2024, in accordance with LREC-COLING 2024, will follow the same 
                            policy as ACL conferences establishing an anonymity period during which non-anonymous 
                            posting of preprints is not allowed. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Papers that have been or will be under consideration for other venues at the same time must be 
                            declared at submission time. If a paper is accepted for publication at DMR 2024, it 
                            must be immediately withdrawn from other venues. If a paper under review at DMR 
                            2024 is accepted elsewhere and authors intend to proceed there, the workshop committee must 
                            be notified immediately.

                            accepted papers must notify the program chairs within 10 days of acceptance if the paper is
