                        <p>DMR 2024 invites the submissions of long and short papers about original works on meaning representation. As the theme of DMR 2024,
                            we also invie the submission of orignal research that have in any way leveraged, expanded, or been inspired by the
                            <strong class="text-secondary">``Marthaverse of Meaning.''</strong>

                        </div>

                        <p>
                        DMR intends to bring together researchers who are producers and
                        consumers of meaning representations and through their interaction gain a deeper understanding of the
                        key elements of meaning representations that are the most valuable to the NLP community.
                        The workshop will also provide an opportunity for meaning representation researchers to
                        critically examine existing frameworks with the goal of using their findings to inform the design of
                        next-generation meaning representations. A third goal of the workshop is to explore opportunities and identify
                        challenges in the design and use of meaning representations in multilingual settings. A final goal of the workshop
                        is to understand the relationship between distributed meaning representations trained
                        on large data sets using network models and the symbolic meaning representations that are
                        carefully designed and annotated by NLP researchers, and to gain a deeper understanding of
                        areas where each type of meaning representation is the most effective.

                        </div>

                        <p>Submissions should report original and unpublished research on topics of interest to the workshop.
                            Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop and will be published in the workshop proceedings on the ACL Anthology.
                            They should emphasize obtained results rather than intended work and should clearly indicate
                            the state of completion of the reported results. A paper accepted for presentation at the workshop
                            must not be or have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings.</p>

                        <p>Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system.
                            <a href="https://softconf.com/iwcs2023/dmr2023" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Here</a>
                            is the link to the DMR submission site. Submissions must adhere to the two-column format of ACL venues: please use our specific
                            <a href="https://iwcs2021.github.io/download/iwcs2021-templates.zip" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">style-files</a>
                            or the <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/instructions-for-iwcs-2021-proceedings/fpnsyxqqpfbw"
                                      rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Overleaf template</a>,
                            taken from ACL 2021. Similar to ACL 2021, initial submissions should be fully anonymous to ensure double-blind reviewing.
                            Long papers must not exceed eight (8) pages of content. Short papers and demonstration papers must not exceed four (4) pages of content.
                            If a paper is accepted, it will be given an additional page to address reviewers’ comments in the final version.
                            References and appendices do not count against these limits.</p> <p>Reviewing of papers will be double-blind.
                        Therefore, the paper must not include the authors’ names and affiliations or self-references that reveal any author’s identity–e.g.,
                        “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” should be replaced with citations such as “Smith (1991) previously showed …”.
                        Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.</p> <p>Authors of papers that have been
                        or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must provide this information to the workshop organizers
                        <a href="mailto:%dmr.workshop.0@gmail.com">dmr.workshop.0@gmail.com</a>.
                        Authors of accepted papers must notify the program chairs within 10 days of acceptance if the paper is withdrawn for any reason.</p>
                        <span class="text-danger"> DMR 2023 does not have an anonymity period. However, we ask you to be reasonable and not publicly advertise your preprint during (or right before) review.</span>
